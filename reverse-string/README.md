# Reverse a String

Time Limit: 30 minutes

## Instructions

Write a function in Golang that takes a string as input and returns its
reversal.

Requirements:

Correctly handle Unicode characters (i.e., use runes instead of simple bytes).
The function should handle edge cases such as empty strings.

Example Input and Output:
---
Input: "hello"
Output: "olleh"

Input: "こんにちは"
Output: "はちにんこ"

Input: ""
Output: ""
---

1) Avoid using built-in functions that automatically reverse a string (if any).
2) Be mindful of memory usage when working with large strings.
